## Vision

Ethosengine envisions a future where digital infrastructure serves human needs at a family and community scale. Through distributed computing, trust-based networks, and local-first principles, exploring how technology can enhance rather than extract from human relationships and community bonds.

## Current Focus

This organization houses personal experiments and prototypes in:
- Family-scale compute clusters
- Trust-based networking
- Local-first data sovereignty
- Community resource sharing
- Sustainable tech practices

## Status

ðŸš§ **Early Exploration Stage** ðŸš§

This is currently a personal research and development organization. While the vision is ambitious, development is in early experimental phases. Contributions and discussions are welcome, but expect work-in-progress repositories and evolving architectures.
